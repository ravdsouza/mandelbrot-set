# mandelbrot-set
The Mandelbrot set is a set of complex numbers that follows the function ```f(z)=z^2 + c ``` (where z is in the complex domain and c is a real constant) and does not diverge when iterated. 

This program utilizes Google's TensorFlow library to create a visualisation of the Mandelbrot set.
